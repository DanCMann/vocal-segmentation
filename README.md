Syllable segmenter is a collection of [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) scripts and procedures to divide syllables (acoustic units with silence on either side). It was developed to divided budgerigar complex syllables into segmental units. More details can be found in [Mann et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80340-y.epdf?sharing_token=NNQcY2TEZTAxkOjfNI1VgNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OxYlu0dlriproro0GmGBRL-vemZKvoMpUckWp_9rDrT19oRlhliWRsPJzkug6_mow8TeGyGp4NiK3IOAm7kfGDmRs-BRLFZEN4tr0I7QKtLZ5SNTUEar1b0LcJkxqoieE%3D).

To run, open the *run_program.praat* file in Praat (via Praat's toolbar: *Praat > Open Praat Script...*) and run the script. You run the script by hitting Ctrl+R or *Run > Run* in the toolbar. 

The scripts were originally written in Praat Version 6.0.26 using Windows 10 OS. I recently (2022-06-21) checked the basic functionality on Praat 6.1.09 on a Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). 

Unfortunately, the code is not well-documented and the Praat scripts will likely not be developed much further. The code is currently being converted into a python application.
